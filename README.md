## Project #4: Build a Game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

For your fourth project, you'll be creating a familiar game using HTML, CSS and
JS! Please choose one of the following options:

- **Flash Cards**
- **Trivia (Self-scoring)**
- **Hangman**
- **Tower of Hanoi**
- **Simon**

This is an opportunity to **be creative**, and work through some **tough
programming challenges**.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you
along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

> If you want to choose a different game for Project #4, please consult with an
> instructor! Warning - many seemingly simple games end up being much more
> complex than you might think!

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

Your game must:

- Render in the browser
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Be deployed online, using [Github Project pages](https://pages.github.com)
  and/or to a custom domain.
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
- Show a good commit history with frequent commits

Additionally, your project should stick with KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple) and
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

### Necessary Deliverables

Your submission must include **all** of the following:

- A hosted copy of your game, built by you, hosted on Github Pages
- Your HTML/CSS should pass the [HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu)
  and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- A git repository hosted on Github with frequent commits dating back to the
  very beginning of the project
- A link to your hosted project in the URL section of your Github repo
- A `readme.md` file, including
  - Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation
    instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
  - [Follow this mini-lesson on writing documentation](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-fundamentals/markdown-and-documentation)
    for your project

## Project Choices

### Tower of Hanoi

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower of Hanoi</a> is a
mathematical puzzle where the objective is to move a stack of discs from one rod
to another. There are three rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time
- Every move involves taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it
  on top of another stack
- No disk can be put on top of a smaller disk

_Bonus:_

- Add time-based scoring
- Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
